# stars-and-cloud

Arduino sketch which runs on Raspberry Pico.

A star heaven made from three LEDs (two white, one yellow) connected to cheap fiber optic cables which are stuck through a wood to look like a star heaven. Plus a cloud made from some kind of wool fiber with an RGB LED inside.

The heaven LEDs are supposed to look flickering a bit and get randomly brighter or less bright. The cloud flashes randomly like lightning.

Might add pictures, HW schematics, etc. later.
